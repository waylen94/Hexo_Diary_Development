## Reflection
	[20191009] forget the wireless receiver so i can not continue working network in school. please dont 
 	bring out the study resource in home. it's a place to meditation and read book (long-term purpose) rather than working on current work (short term purpose) or watching the vedio (entertainment in wrong time)

 	[Gift] - The Power of Now paperback (28 days)


Every morning I will get up on 5:00 and focus on the machine learning 1 unit (5:30 - 6:30) ??
